App with different alignment practices, like:  

`CoverFlowContentView` displays a horizontally-scrollable list of rectangles with rotating 3D effects. Each rectangle's color rotates based on its position, creating a dynamic visual effect.
 The `ScrollEffectsContentView` displays a vertically-scrollable list of text rows, each with varying opacity, scale, and background color based on its position in the scroll view. It demonstrates how to apply rotation, opacity, and scale effects to elements based on their position.
 The `OuterView` struct contains a VStack with text views "Top" and "Bottom" and an `InnerView` view in between. The `InnerView` struct contains an HStack with text views "Left" and "Right" and a GeometryReader that displays "Center" text. It prints the coordinates of the center of the GeometryReader when tapped.
 The `CoordinateSpacesContentView` struct demonstrates coordinate space usage by nesting an `OuterView` inside it and applying a custom coordinate space named "Custom" to the `OuterView`. 
The `CustomAlignmentGuideContentView` struct defines a custom vertical alignment guide for aligning text and images vertically centered. It showcases the usage of alignment guides with a custom alignment named "midAccountAndName". 
The `SimpleAlignmentGuideContentView` struct demonstrates a simple alignment guide applied to text views in a VStack, adjusting their leading alignment based on their position.
 The `SimpleAlignmentContentView` struct showcases basic alignment behavior with text views aligned to the leading edge. `ContentView` struct displays text views aligned using the last text baseline alignment option, ensuring consistent text alignment across different font sizes.
